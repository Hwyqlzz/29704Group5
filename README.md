<h2>Problem Description:</h2>
I am the owner/operator of a tennis club called "Green Valley Tennis Center," located in Athens, Georgia. Our club is a premium tennis facility that caters to tennis enthusiasts of all ages and skill levels. We offer a range of services, from professional coaching and training to court rentals, leagues, tournaments, and a pro shop. Our goal is to provide a top-notch experience for tennis players and create a vibrant and welcoming tennis community in our area.
<h2>Data Model:</h2>
<h2>Data Dictionary:</h2>
<h2>Querise:</h2>

Query 1 lists a query listing out the playerID, player name, and the number of court reservations per player.

This will allow the club to recognize how many times an athlete has been booked. This allows for some packages or discounts to be offered to those with more bookings.

Query 2 lists a query that lists the information for all the players who have not made a court reservation.

This allows the club to market to and contact specific customers ( promotional emails or coupons). This helps to maximize revenue and efficiency as it specifically targets those who are not engaged in the booking rather than wasting time and resources advertising to those who are already engaged in the booking.
